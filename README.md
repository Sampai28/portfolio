## About Me

With a Computer Science background from Manipal Institute of Technology, I've journeyed from being an undergraduate research assistant to a Data Engineering intern, and most recently, a part of Shell’s Cyber Defence team. I’ve gained hands-on experience across **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Data Pipelining**, and **Security**. I love exploring new ideas—whether in research or competing in cybersecurity tournaments like Boss of the SOC—because technology's greatest appeal to me is how it challenges me to learn, collaborate, and make an impact.
